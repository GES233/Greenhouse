{{ README_WITH_WHOLE_SOURCE_CODE }} # ~2k lines of code

Analyze this source code, extract the core functionality, inputs and outputs, key algorithms, and potential error handling. Then, based on these, create a Skills folder, including SKILL.md (containing name, description, when_to_use, core instruction steps, and decision logic), optional script files, and a reference template. Ensure that Skills enables the AI ​​to handle similar tasks as the original project.
